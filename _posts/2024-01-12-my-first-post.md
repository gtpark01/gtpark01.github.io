I am a Physics researcher at Kyung Hee University, focusing on inverse design, multilayer photonic structures, and machine learning.

My recent research has focused on designing optical multilayer structures using machine learning optimization frameworks.

Recent Publications:
1. Conformal antireflective multilayers for high-numerical-aperture deep-ultraviolet lenses (Advanced Optical Materials, 2024)
2. Binary-Optimization-Based Multilayers and Their Practical Applications (Current Optics and Photonics, 2024)
